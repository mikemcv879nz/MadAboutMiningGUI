## Security / Antivirus Notice

This application is built using Python + PyInstaller.
As a result, a small number of antivirus engines may flag the executable as "generic" or "riskware".

VirusTotal scan results:
4 / 69 detections — all major vendors (Microsoft Defender, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, ESET, Sophos, etc.) report clean.

This is a known and common false-positive pattern for PyInstaller-based applications.
